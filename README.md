# Demo - Fuel Station frontend
Small demo project for displaying and editing fuel stations.

## Setup
Download this git repo (https://github.com/whiteseppel/fuelStationFrontend) and 
install all dependencies with `flutter pub get`. Afterwards you can run the 
application with `flutter run` or just start it in Android Studio or VS Code. 

You will also need to host the backend of this project for the app to display the
fuel stations correctly. All data is only loaded from the backend, there currently is 
no device persistence.
